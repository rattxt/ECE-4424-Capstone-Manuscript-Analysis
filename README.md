# ECE 4424 Capstone Project: Manuscript Analysis

This project aims to analyze the handwriting in Medieval manuscripts in an attempt to identify similarities within the writing and predict whether or not two manuscripts were penned by the same scribe.  

In order to run this project needs the .py file and two folders.  The first folder, 'manuscript_data', contains the training/validation data.  The second folder is 'test_scribes', which contains the data for the project.  Both folders can contain sub-folders and these sub-folders can have any name.  Edit the code on line 371 to change the test folder.
